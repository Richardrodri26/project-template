## Purpose

Short, actionable notes to help AI coding agents be productive in this repository.

## Big-picture architecture

- Single-page React (React 19) app scaffolded with Vite + TypeScript. Main entry: `src/main.tsx`.
- Routing: TanStack Router with file-based routes under `src/routes/`. A generated tree `src/routeTree.gen.ts` wires routes into the router—do NOT edit the generated file.
- Global providers (React Query, theme) are composed in `src/components/providers/index.tsx` and applied in `main.tsx` via `Providers`.
- UI and building blocks live under `src/components/ui/` and domain/features under `src/features/`.
- Data: both REST/axios and GraphQL are in dependencies. GraphQL codegen is available via `npm run gql:gen`.

## Key files to reference

- `package.json` — scripts (dev/build/test/gql:gen). Use `npm run dev` for local development.
- `vite.config.ts` — plugins in use: `@tanstack/router-plugin/vite` (file-based routing + autoCodeSplitting), `@tailwindcss/vite`.
- `tsconfig.json` — strict TypeScript settings and path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — generated by TanStack Router. Do not modify; modify source files in `src/routes/` instead.
- `src/components/providers/` — contains `TanstackQueryProvider.tsx` and `theme-provider.tsx` used by the app.

## Developer workflows (commands)

- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server (hot reload): `npm run dev` (runs `vite --port 3000`)
- Build (production): `npm run build` (runs `vite build && tsc` — note: `tsc` runs to ensure types)
- Preview production build: `npm run serve` (runs `vite preview`)
- Tests: `npm run test` (runs `vitest run`)
- Generate GraphQL types: `npm run gql:gen` (configured in `package.json`)

When editing routes, add files under `src/routes/`. The TanStack Vite plugin will regenerate `routeTree.gen.ts` (auto code-splitting enabled in `vite.config.ts`).

## Conventions and patterns to follow

- Routes: file-based. Example mapping (from `src/routeTree.gen.ts`): `src/routes/__app/app/index.tsx` → `/app`.
- Use `createFileRoute` or the file export `export const Route = ...` pattern as existing route files do (see `src/routes/__app.tsx`).
- Providers: wrap cross-cutting concerns in `src/components/providers/` and use `Providers` in `src/main.tsx`.
- Styling: Tailwind via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin and project CSS in `src/styles.css`.
- Type safety: tsconfig is strict and prevents unused locals/params. Keep code tidy and type-checked; `npm run build` runs `tsc`.
- Aliases: import with `@/` for `src/` paths (e.g., `import { AdminLayout } from '@/features/Layouts/AdminLayout'`).

## Data & fetching

- React Query is used; the Query client is created in `src/components/providers/TanstackQueryProvider.tsx`.
- GraphQL: `@apollo/client` + `graphql-codegen` present. Run `npm run gql:gen` to regenerate types/operations when schema or queries change.

## Things not to edit

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` — generated; change the files in `src/routes/` instead.
- Any other generated artifacts created by codegen tools (check `codegen.ts` if present).

## Quick examples

- Add a new top-level route: create `src/routes/newpage.tsx` exporting `export const Route = createFileRoute('/newpage')({ component: ... })` or follow the existing file structure.
- Change global theme default: update `src/components/providers/index.tsx` (it passes `defaultTheme` = "dark" today).

## Notes for AI agents

- Prefer editing source files under `src/` (routes, components, features). Run `npm run dev` locally to verify changes.
- Respect generated files and TypeScript strictness. After edits, run `npm run build` to catch type issues early (the script runs `tsc`).
- When suggesting new dependencies, prefer packages already used (e.g., TanStack, Radix UI, Tailwind) and update `package.json` scripts if needed.

If anything above is unclear or you'd like explicit CI/test commands, tell me what to add and I will iterate.
